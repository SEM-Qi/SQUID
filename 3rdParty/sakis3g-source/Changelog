            locale. (Thanks mortaromarcello!)
          o Added an example sakis3g.conf for reference.
    * Fixed the following issues:
          o Added the build directory with an .empty file in it to avoid having to
            take an extra step when compiling.
    * Operators' database:
          o Added the following networks:
                + 52015:QUB (Cambodia).
          o Updated South African icons for Mobile Networks.

0.2.0e	2013/07/03

    * Modified functionality:
          o Sakis3g (and compile scripts) now require only bash to be installed
            to work. Bash does not have to be the default shell.
    * Fixed the following issues:
          o Modified Usb-ModeSwitch database to use the old format that they 
            dropped early in 2012. All devices should work again.
    * Embedded Usb-ModeSwitch:
          o Upgraded to version 1.2.6.
          o Device database upgraded to 2013-06-10 version.
    * Operators' database:
          o Added the following networks:
                + 65502: 8.ta (South Africa).

0.2.0e	2010/07/09

    * New functionality:
          o French translation is now available for those using a unicode fr_FR
            locale.
    * Modified functionality:
          o Debug output now includes name of function, emitting debug message,
            as well.
    * Fixed the following issues:
          o TRANSLATION variable is now properly taken into account.
          o BAUD=MAX, BAUD=MIN and BAUD=DEFAULT now work properly.
          o Disassembling Sakis3G script, back into its contents, should now be
            possible even for distributions shipping a "tar" version prior to
            1.20.
          o Script now queries modem, about network it is registered to, using
            proper AT-command. This should eliminate cases where querying modem
            resulted into it unregistering network instead (like Huawei E1820).
          o Fixed a regression issue, introduced by 0.2.0d, which resulted into
            user being asked twice about driver to be used. This affected only
            users of old kernels, or users of new devices (i.e. users who's
            kernel was not recognizing USB IDs).
    * Embedded Usb-ModeSwitch:
          o Upgraded to version 1.1.3.
          o Device database upgraded to 2010-06-23 version.
    * Operators' database:
          o Modified following networks:
                + 23402: O2 (UK): Added one more APN.
                + 23410: O2 (UK): Added one more APN.
                + 23411: O2 (UK): Added one more APN.
                + 23415: Vodafone (UK): Added "new PAYG" APN.
          o Added the following networks:
                + 51001: IndosatM2 (Indonesia).
                + 51089: 3 (Indonesia).
                + 52015: ToT (Thailand).

0.2.0d  2010/06/07

    * New functionality:
          o German translation is now available for those using a unicode en_DE 
            locale.
          o Script now offers manual network selection whenever modem fails to 
            automatically register one.
          o Configuration variable PREPARE was introduced, allowing custom AT 
            commands to be sent to modem before any other command is issued.
          o Configuration variable BAUD was introduced, allowing to explicitly
            set baud rate "pppd" and/or "wvdial" should use. Consult 
            documentation for more information.
          o Switch "--guruplug" was introduced, instructing script to attempt
            utilizing leds, found on GuruPlug devices, for indicating progress,
            errors and success.
    * Modified functionality:
          o Script does not anymore wait for modem to register a network, 
            before forcing network specified by FORCE_ISP variable.
    * Fixed the following issues:
          o DCOP based versions of "kdialog" now work better (still far from
            being perfect). Users of such a "kdialog" version, who still face
            problems, are encouraged to:
                + Either install and use "zenity" (--zenity switch), or 
                + Use a text-mode UI through "konsole" (--konsole switch).
          o "nostorage" switch now works as it should. First attempts to unbind
            usb_storage from device, before attempting to globally unload
            module. This should fix cases with:
                + kernels having usb_storage built-in and not as a module,
                + users having other usb_storage devices mounted which prevent
                  module from unloading.
          o In cases where operator name is extracted by SIM, first byte is
            properly considered a flag and not part of the name. This should
            prevent a non-printable character being displayed before operator's
            name.
          o Fixed an issue which prevented some cdc_acm driven devices from 
            working with some kernel versions.
          o Progress bar should now ascend in a more consistent way.
          o Text within dialog boxes does not anymore erratically wraps when a 
            translation for current locale exists, still selected UI does not
            allow translations.
          o Script will now display translated text even if "UTF8" sub-string 
            of locale used, is typed in lowercase.
          o Fixed an issue which was resulting into both:
                + Root instances of script being unable to access X display 
                  from which they were initiated,
                + File "$HOME/-n" and/or "/root/-n" being created and never 
                  being deleted.
    * Icons embedded in script had been on diet.
    * Changelog file is now human readable (like this: "sakis3g Changelog").
    * Operators' database:
          o Modified following networks:
                + 24004: Sweden 3G: Corrected Tele2 APN.
                + 24005: Sweden 3G: Corrected Tele2 APN.
                + 24007: Tele2 (Sweden): APN corrected.
                + 26803: Optimus (Portugal): Added "Clix" APN.

0.2.0c  2010/05/14

    * Modified functionality:
          o APN_USER and APN_PASS variables now override corresponding values 
            loaded from operator database. This would allow using custom APN 
            username and password for misconfigured APNs.
    * Fixed the following issues:
          o Helper now obeys 1st "Exit" request, without a second one required.
          o Script should now work with older wvdial versions as well.
    * Operators' database:
          o Modified following networks:
                + 23430: T-Mobile (United Kingdom): Added "Virgin" APN.
                + 23802: Telenor (Denmark): Added "BiBoB" APN.
          o Added the following networks:
                + 23402: O2 (United Kingdom)
                + 23410: O2 (United Kingdom)
                + 23411: O2 (United Kingdom)
                + 23415: Vodafone (United Kingdom)
                + 23420: 3 (United Kingdom)
                + 23431: Virgin (United Kingdom)
                + 23432: Virgin (United Kingdom)
                + 23433: Orange (United Kingdom)
                + 23434: Orange (United Kingdom)
                + 23801: TDC (Denmark)
                + 23806: 3 DK (Denmark)
                + 23806: OiSTER (Denmark)
                + 23820: Telia  (Denmark)
                + 23830: Telia  (Denmark)

0.2.0b  2010/05/04

Fixed the following issues:
    * Better parsing of lsusb output.
    * Improved compatibility for shell environments without FUNCNAME 
      environment variable support.
    * Removed --keep-tite argument when invoking dialog.

0.2.0a  2010/05/02

Fixed the following issues:
    * Fixed an issue on systems which provide /proc/bus/usb/devices. Issue had 
      been preventing devices from being properly parsed.
    * Fixed an issue prevent script to work with shells not providing FUNCNAME 
      environment variable.
    * Fixed an issue where script was incorrectly following wrong HAL storage 
      polling proccess. Issue had been resulting into script waiting for a
      useless period of 20 seconds.
    * Fixed an issue with devices offering more than one storage interfaces 
      after being switched. Employed solution should be revised in the future.
    * Script now waits for 20 seconds for tty node to get created by driver.
    * Usb-ModeSwitch is now always called with the -I argument. This should 
      prevent Usb-ModeSwitch from getting blocked for some devices.
    * Renamed "/ChangeLog" file to "/Changelog"

0.2.0 	2010/04/28

Sakis3G script version 0.2.0 is written from scratch and is not derived from 
0.1.3 (now called legacy) series.

    * Examples, user guides, instructions and documentation for legacy version, 
      are not applicable to 0.2.0 series.
    * Modified functionality:
          o Drastically improved workflow and device selection procedure, 
            allowing even more USB modems to work with Sakis3G script.
          o Permanently dropped dependency to sharutils/uudecode. Script now 
            depends on bunzip2 and tar instead.
          o 9menu binary is not anymore embedded in script, still can be used 
            if "--9menu" or "--legacy" switches are specified.
          o Menu, presented by user interface, now has more options.
          o Removed "replacedefaultroute" from pppd arguments since several 
            pppd versions do not recognize it. Script anyway fixes routing
            table, unless newly introduced "--nofix" switch is set.
          o You no longer need to provide connection details, again, when using 
            "reconnect" argument, while connected.
          o Several command line arguments and variables are now obsolete or 
            replaced. Consult documentation for more details.
          o Setting environment variables, before invoking script, is not 
            anymore encouraged. Instead, they can now be supplied as arguments
            or within configuration files. Consult documentation for more
            details.
          o Employed a workaround for "gksu" versions which do not respect 
            arguments containing whitespace characters.
          o Employed a workaround for modems not properly displaying operator's 
            name. Name is read from operator's database, if an entry exists.
          o Improved method of acquiring access to a running X session, when 
            invoked with root privileges.
          o Kernel module loading/unloading is now safer and cleaner. Script 
            now attempts to unload module only when it refuses to unbind from
            device.
          o Script should now be able to utilize even more USB modems (and not 
            just option.ko handled ones).
          o Modems can now be recognized and setup according to the model name 
            they report, and not by their USB IDs.
          o Script can now understand whether pppd or wvdial succeeded, or 
            failed, into getting connected, and success is not determined upon
            timeouts.
          o Improved desktop shortcut creation method.
          o Several, less important, modifications. 
    * New functionality:
          o A more sophisticated concept for command line arguments has been 
            introduced for those wishing to max out possibilities.
          o Command line arguments, environment variables and user input are 
            now sanitized before being used. This should reduce risk of a
            malicious user passing specially crafted values.
          o Several new configuration variables are now introduced, allowing 
            better overall control over performed actions.
          o Connection information is now available, while connection is still 
            running.
          o Configurations file(s) are now possible. Consult documentation for 
            more information.
          o Script can now discover available/best fitted kernel module(s) for 
            a USB modem.
          o Script can now create character device nodes, within /dev 
            directory, when system did not already.
          o Script now takes care of not becoming "stalled" when a broken USB 
            device blocks access to USB bus.
          o Script now exclusively locks "org.freedesktop.Hal.Device.Storage" 
            before switching a device, unless "--nohal" switch is set. This 
            improves stability by reducing simultaneous operations to storage
            and modem interfaces of a USB device.
          o Script now utilizes "avoid_reset_quirk" available in recent kernels.
          o Script now checks for mandatory dependencies being present in PATH, 
            before proceeding with execution.
          o Script now instructs pppd to use file /etc/ppp/peers/sakis3g, if 
            file exists and pppd is used for connection.
          o Script now offers a UI for selecting and setting up nearby 
            Bluetooth devices, to be used as modems.
          o When operator is not found within embedded operators' database, 
            script attempts to fetch last APN, modem was used with, by querying
            modem.
          o Subscribers to virtual operators are now presented their operator's 
            name instead of network's name. This is possible by reading service
            provider's name from SIM card, if modem permits it.
          o Script can now use "zenity", for becoming a "background process" 
            reachable through an icon in notification area, when "helper"
            command line argument is used.
          o It is now possible to keep "secret" a modem from HAL by using 
            "--nohalinform" switch.
          o It is now possible to request for storage part of a USB device 
            being "eliminated", using "--nostorage" switch, which might improve
            stability on some devices.
          o It is now possible to construct a binary free version of script, 
            suitable for all architects. However, binary free version depends
            on a working Usb-ModeSwitch installation, for setting up switchable
            USB devices.
          o It is now possible to disassemble script, back to its ingredients, 
            by using "disassemble" command line argument.
          o Script can now switch devices, not found within embedded 
            Usb-ModeSwitch device database, if appropriate file is found within 
            /etc/usb_modeswitch.d directory.
          o Script now embeds man pages, accessible using "man" command line 
            argument.
          o Script now allows UTF-8 translations, so that localized versions 
            appear in the future. A translation is currently available only for
            Greek language.
          o Several, less important, newly introduced functionality. 
    * User interface:
          o Sakis3G now has its own Tux icon. Icon is used when creating 
            desktop shortcut, unless an operator logo is available and user
            selects that one instead.
          o Script can now use anyone of "kdialog", "zenity", "Xdialog", 
            "9menu", "whiptail" and "dialog" for displaying user interface.
                + If none of them is available, script can resemble an 
                  elementary text-mode user interface through shell builtin
                  functions, if "--interactive" switch is set. 
          o Balloon notifications can now appear, when "--balloons" switch is 
            set, using libnotify.
          o All options available through user interface, are available as 
            command line arguments as well. The opposite statement is not true.
          o Translations are not used when:
                + using "Xdialog" or "9menu" as user interface.
                + displaying OSD messages.
                + Switch "--notranslate" is set. 
    * Embedded Usb-ModeSwitch:
          o Upgraded to version 1.1.2alpha.
          o Device database upgraded to 2010-04-18 version.
          o It is now possible to compile it for your platform, by using 
            "recompile" command line argument, or by selecting equivalent UI
            option.
          o It is now possible to directly reach embedded Usb-ModeSwitch 
            binary, by using "usb_modeswitch" command line argument. 
    * Operators' database:
          o Entries available in legacy version were migrated to 0.2.0 version.
          o You can now connect to any operator, even if not found within 
            operators' database. You just need to know APN details.
          o It is not anymore possible/required to add operators by modifying 
            script.
          o Modified following networks:
                + 20201: Cosmote (Greece): Included an extra APN.
                + 20209: Wind (Greece): Added "Q" APN.
                + 20210: Wind (Greece): Added "Q" APN.
                + 26202: Vodafone (Germany): Added "1und1" APN.
                + 26204: Vodafone (Germany): Added "1und1" APN.
                + 26209: Vodafone (Germany): Added "1und1" APN.
                + 26801: Vodafone (Portugal): Added "ZON" APN. 
          o Added the following operators:
                + 23430: T-Mobile (United Kingdom)
                + 23802: Telenor (Denmark)
                + 34001: Orange (French Caraibes)

0.1.3e 	2010/02/11

Script now utilizes modems that while not advertising their GSM capabilities, 
they still provide their IMEI number (which indicates GSM functionality).
0.1.3d 	2010/02/10

    * Updated settings for operators:
          o 20205: Vodafone (Greece): Added prepay (CU) APN.

0.1.3c 	2010/02/07

    * Added support for operators:
          o 20801: Orange (France)
          o 20810: SFR (France)
          o 20811: SFR (France)

          o 28001: Cytamobile Vodafone (Cyprus)
          o 28010: MTN (Cyprus) 
    * Fixed following issues:
          o Now checking if /usr/lib/kde4/libexec/kdesu is available if no 
            other graphical su is found. This will allow using graphical su
            on KDE4 systems. 

0.1.3b 	2010/02/05

    * Upgraded to Usb-ModeSwitch device database that was released on 
      2010/02/03.
    * Fixed the following issues:
          o Notification appearing after connecting with "toggle" argument, now 
            also displays operator name.
          o Whenever script awaits network logon (usually after supplying PIN), 
            instead of querying modem every one second for a maximum of 15
            seconds (15 tries, one second difference), now queries every four
            seconds for a maximum of 20 seconds (5 tries, 4 seconds difference).
            This may help some modems.
          o When Xterm window appears to prompt user for PIN number, all 
            required information are not read from scratch anymore. This
            eliminates issues where environment is not passed to child process
            and accelerates overall operation.
          o When Xterm window appears to prompt user for PIN number, while 
            DEBUG variable is SET, user has to press Ctrl+C for window to
            vanish.
          o Script does not anymore jump to an existing X session of user that 
            invoked it, if user invoked it from a tty console.
          o If called from udevd, now properly captures access to X DISPLAY :0.
                + Uses xauth to gain access, if not having already, and drops 
                  access when exiting, if it had not access before.
                + Only does so, if only one non-root user currently has an X 
                  session running. 
          o Some initialization stuff is skipped when invoked with a 
            "don't-really-do-anything" argument like "help", "status",
            "version".
          o Script now makes sure PATH includes /bin, /usr/bin, /sbin and 
            /usr/sbin before proceeding.
          o Timestamp information, when running with DEBUG set, now only 
            displays time information, skipping date part. 

0.1.3 	2010/02/04

This version is an "emergency" release which fixes regression issues introduced 
by 0.1.2.

    * Improved udev integration.
    * Added logposition configuration variable which indicates log file that 
      should be used when running as a udev rule.
    * A "debug" method now takes care of displaying debug output when DEBUG 
      variable is set. Displays PID and timestamp along with message. Also
      reduced script size for 5KB.
    * Fixed the following issues:
          o Josua Dietze provided a bug report and a patch for serial device 
            autodetection procedure which fixes a regression issue, introduced
            by 0.1.2, preventing many modems from having their correct tty
            device chosen.
          o Fixed a regression issue, introduced by 0.1.2, which required a 
            modem to be connected even when executing with the "help" argument.
          o When first using script, 9menu interface does not any more appear 
            as "Unnamed window".
          o Configuration variable "debug" is now renamed to "DEBUG". This 
            allows for method "debug" to be defined. 

0.1.2 	2010/02/01

    * Added better serial tty detection. This method will allow more unknown 
      modems to work.
    * Added support for user defined modems. To use a user defined modem, 
      USBMODEM variable must contain USB IDs in "XXXX:XXXX" hex form.
          o If a specific driver is also required, USBDRIVER variable can be 
            used and should contain the module required to be loaded.
          o Examples:
                + By exporting variables:
                  $ export USBMODEM=1199:68a3
                  $ export USBDRIVER=sierra
                  $ sakis3g connect
                + Or, in command line:
                  $ USBMODEM=1199:68a3 \
                  > USBDRIVER=sierra \
                  > sakis3g connect
                + Or, by editting this script and place them below MYVERSION 
                  variable (especially if using sudo for getting root 
                  privileges).
          o When no known/switched modem is found, and USBMODEM variable is not 
            set, 9menu users are presented a list of currently connected USB
            devices to choose their modem from. 
    * An embedded 9menu binary is now included in script.
      If:
          o prefer_osd and stick_to_console are NOT set, and
          o an X DISPLAY IS detected, and
          o uudecode IS present, then 
      embedded 9menu binary is utilized. 
    * Script now works flawlessly on LiveCD images that do not provide writable 
      home directories.
    * Added support for the following operators:
          o 70401: Claro (Guatemala)
          o 70402: Tigo (Guatemala) 
    * Added support for the following modems:
          o 1c9e:f000 GBC PL68 
    * Fixed the following issues:
          o Drastically improved workflow to avoid executing same things twice 
            or more. Overral operation is now faster.
          o Does not any more randomly pickup a modem when more than one modems 
            are available. 9menu users are provided a list of modems to choose
            from. OSD and command line users must provide its name or USB
            IDs as an extra command line argument. Argument must be long enough
            to distinguish just one modem.
                + Example:
                      # If two ZTE modems are connected, then doing "sakis3g 
                        connect ZTE" will fail, while "sakis3g connect MF636"
                        will work (if they are not both of the same model). 
          o Supported modems are not any more detected twice as both their 
            official name and as their SWITCHED equivalent.
          o If more than one modems are connected, does not any more silently 
            proceed with second one, if first one failed to connect for
            whatever reason.
          o Moved several parts, of autogenerated part, in the first part. 
            Released around 130 KB, given current device database of
            Usb-ModeSwitch.
          o Fixed a long existing issue preventing some switchable devices from 
            being properly switched. Was providing wrong configuration file to 
            Usb-ModeSwitch. Affected devices are a subset of devices with IDs:
            05c6:1000 and 19d2:2000.
          o Setting stick_to_console does not any more imply alwayssudo. You 
            must explicitly set alwayssudo for sudo to be used.
          o Less output should now appear when debug or VERBOSE are not set.
          o User is now notified if tty device is occupied by another process. 
            This will help users understand whether their modemmanager is
            messing with their ports.
          o Unknown, switched and user-defined modems are all now given a 10 
            seconds period to settle connection with driver. This increases
            time required to connect, but sets more unsupported modems usable.
          o When debug variable is set, output is now more rich during modem 
            switching.
          o Large pack of comments found on top part of script are now more 
            readable.
          o Added copyright notices:
                + when called with the "help" argument.
                + on 9menu interface, before connecting. 

0.1.1 	2010/01/25

    * Now using fresh 1.1.0 version of Usb-ModeSwitch and 2010/01/24 device 
      database.
    * Added support for operators offering more than one APNs.
          o FORCE_APN variable must be set if operator provides more than one 
            APNs, or if requires subscriber number to be included in username
            or password for ppp connection. 
    * VERXOSD option is renamed to VERBOSE and is now turned off by default.
    * Added support for operators:
          o 22201: TIM (Italy)
          o 22210: Vodafone (Italy)
          o 22288: WIND (Italy)
          o 22299: Tre (Italy)
          o 26202: Vodafone (Germany)
          o 26207: O2 (Germany)
          o 26216: Vistream (Germany)
          o 28601: Vodafone (Portugal)
          o 28603: Optimus (Portugal)
          o 28606: TMN (Portugal)
          o 70802: Tigo (Honduras) 
    * Fixed the following issues:
          o Script now waits for network logon even for SIM cards that do not 
            need PIN number.
          o Script does not any more switch modem if called with the "help" or 
            "status" arguments. 

0.1.0 	2010/01/20

    * Added progress bar functionality for xosd (osd_cat) users.
    * Added support for the following operators:
          o 20209: Wind (Greece)
          o 23201: Mobilkom/A1 (Austria)
          o 23203: T-Mobile AT (Austria)
          o 23205: Orange AT (Austria)
          o 23207: T-Mobile AT (Austria)
          o 23210: Drei AT (Austria)
          o 26201: T-Mobile D1 (Germany)
          o 26203: E-Plus (Germany)
          o 26205: E-Plus (Germany)
          o 26206: T-Mobile D1 (Germany)
          o 26277: E-Plus (Germany)
          o 27602: VODAFONE (Albania) 
    * Fixed the following issues:
          o If "option" driver fails to create devices, it removes it before 
            attempting with driver specified by modem configuration.
          o Chown operations now do not also define group.
          o Desktop shortcut is now chmoded to 744.
          o After supplying PIN number to modem, script now waits for network 
            logon prior to continuing. 

0.0.9 	2010/01/15

Fixed the following issues:

    * Ironic messages appearing when cleaning up files in "/tmp", do not appear 
      any more.
    * Added wait interval support for devices requiring it (only Huawei E170 
      and family so far). 

0.0.8 	2010/01/14

    * Added experimental support for modems:
          o 12d1:1003: Huawei E170 E220 E230 E270 E870 
    * Fixed the following issues:
          o Does not mess with HAL for unknown modems.
          o Now uses a combination of UID/EUID/USER for determining if root or 
            not. Not all shells set all three of them. 

0.0.7 	2010/01/13

    * If no gksu/kdesu is found, switches to normal su. Sudo is now used only 
      when no X display is found, or when stick_to_console is set, or when
      alwayssudo is set.
    * Fixed the following issues:
          o Script had been checking for pppd/wvdial existence, prior to being 
            root.
          o Script now checks for "chat" existence before proceeding.
          o Now relies on UID, instead of EUID for determining being root or 
            not. 

0.0.6 	2010/01/12

    * Added xosd support. xosd is used if neither 9menu nor aosd_cat are 
      installed. It is more popular among distributions. If xosd is also not
      found, fallbacks to terminal.
    * Fixed the following issues:
          o Calls to "which" redirect stderr output to /dev/null. This should 
            eliminate spamming occuring on some configurations.
          o When "gksu" is not present, checks if "kdesu" exists, and uses that 
            one instead. This should prevent it from using "su" on KDE
            environments.

0.0.5 	2010/01/10

    * Added HAL support (fallbacks to previous method if HAL is not available):
          o /dev/tty* device is determined by accessing HAL devices.
          o HAL is updated of modem capabilities if not already set. This 
            should make modem device appear on hal-aware programs. 
    * Added command line argument "setup", which only setups modem(s):
          o Switches modem (if not switched).
          o Loads kernel driver (if not loaded).
          o Updates HAL for modem capabilities (if not already aware). 
          Using this argument, can be used as udev rule for setting up device 
          and allow use by other applications. 
    * Now uses option driver and if still no serial devices appear, the one on 
      config is used instead.
    * Fixed the following bugs:
          o Now makes sure it has root privileges before invoking 
            usb_modeswitch.
          o If modem gets disconnected, while 9menu is running, it scans if 
            other usable hardware is present. If not, aborts like it used to do.

0.0.4 	2010/01/09

Updated so that includes newer 1.0.7 version of Usb_ModeSwitch.

0.0.3 	2010/01/04

    * Sakis3G now embeds whole Usb_ModeSwitch 2009/12/28 database. This makes 
      clear to whom, one should refer if facing problems. Issue a "sakis3g 
      connect" from a terminal and watch for messages appearing. If your modem
      gets properly switched, you should contact Sakis3G author. If modem does
      not get switched, is probably a new device and you should contact
      Usb_ModeSwitch forums for further troubleshooting instructions.
    * Sakis3G now utilizes devices on Usb_ModeSwitch device list with default 
      initialization strings, even if not supported by Sakis3G itself. To
      identify whether your modem is used like this, issue "sakis3g help".
      If SWITCHED_MODEM is identified as present hardware, then your modem is
      used with default values (and may not work).
    * Sakis3G now detects tty devices appearing from the USB Bus that your 
      modem is attached on, autodetecting appropriate tty device. This should
      handle cases where other devices, USB or not, create /dev/tty* nodes,
      leading to the wrong node being selected. If you still have wrong
      /dev/tty* node selected, try using another USB port. Try "lsusb -t" to
      see what else devices reside on the same USB bus as your modem. 

0.0.2 	2010/01/02

Initial version published to celebrate blog creation. Only author's equipment 
and operators are supported.

    * Added comments and instructions within shell script, to increase 
      reusability. 

0.0.1 	Can't remember

Made initially by the author to allow family members to use 3G connections, and 
easier installation accross different home PCs.
