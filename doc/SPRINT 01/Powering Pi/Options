OPTIONS FOR THE RASPBERRY PI POWER SUPPLY | Aure 2013.05.11

1. Battery bank (4xAA Batteries) , 2 hours of use

	ADVANTAGES
	- extra battery power
	- easy to implement
	- already on its way (20.march)
	
	DISADVANTAGES
	- weight
	- might not be compatible with checking the power of the quad

2. Power over the BEC, x

	ADVANTAGES
	- less weight

	DISAVANTAGES
	- need to cut open a Micro USB cable and solder it with the BEC
	
3. Power directly from the lipo

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Since we are at the moment not aiming for a maximal flight time, extra weight is not
	a big concern.
	
	For reasons that are obvious we will use the Battery Bank for now.
